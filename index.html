                        <h1>Using social media data to understand the impact of promotional information on laypeople’s discussions: the case of Lynch syndrome
</h1>
                        <h3 id="Text1">Introduction</h3><br>
                        <p>In 2000, President Bill Clinton signed a White House Proclamation that March to be designated as the Colon Cancer Awareness Month to bring attention to the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States.  Lynch syndrome, also known as non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), is an inherited disorder that increases the risk of colon and rectum cancers in particular, and many other types of cancer such as stomach, liver, gallbladder ducts, small intestine, upper urinary tract, brain, and skin.[1]  Lynch syndrome is the most common cause of hereditary colorectal cancer, accounting for approximately 2-3% of inherited colon cancer cases.[2]  March 22 is recognized as the Lynch Syndrome Awareness Day by communities around the world.[3] 
                        <br>
                        <p>Social media brought rapid changes to the health communication landscape.  In particular, social media platforms have been used to promote healthy behavior,[4] improve medical and patient education,[5, 6] overcome barriers in the delivery of health care,[7] and address public health surveillance issues.[8, 9] On one side, public health stakeholders including health organizations, government agencies, pharmaceutical companies, news media, and advocators, use social media to broadly disseminate health information on the Internet.  On the other hand, laypeople share their personal health experience, and post comments and express opinions towards specific health issues, medical products, and health care services.  However, there have been very few studies on Lynch syndrome and social media.  Through a PubMed search, we found only one study, where the authors asked an advocacy organization to disseminate their study information on Facebook to show the feasibility of recruiting participants with Lynch syndrome on a social media platform.[10]<br>
                        <p>Twitter is a free social media platform that enables users to send and read short 140-character posts called “tweets.”  Twitter analyses have been used in numerous biomedical and public health studies, with a broad range of health topics.[11]  For example, Broniatowski et al. have successfully used Twitter data for influenza surveillance.[12]  Workewych et al. hypothesized that Twitter data might be useful for understanding public perceptions and misperceptions of sport-related traumatic brain injuries.[13]  Massey et al. quantified Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination communication on Twitter and used sentiment analysis to examined people’s attitudes towards HPV vaccination.[14]  Cole-Lewis et al. conducted a content analysis to identify key conversation trends about e-Cigarettes by using historical Twitter data.[15]<br>
                        <p>In this paper, we use Lynch syndrome as a case study to find popular Lynch syndrome-related topics discussed on Twitter, examine the correlations between promotional Lynch syndrome-related information (e.g., information related to advertising, sales promotion, and public relations) and laypeople’s discussions, and learn the influence of Lynch syndrome awareness events on laypeople’s discussions.  Analyzing laypeople’s discussions on Twitter will be an extremely helpful tool to glean into laypeople’s awareness, perceptions and attitudes toward Lynch syndrome and colorectal cancer for various stakeholders including pharmaceutical companies, government agencies, health care organizations and professionals, and news media.  For example, health advocacy groups can adjust their health communication strategies from learning the hot topics in laypeople’s discussions to optimize the dissemination of promotional health information.  Through understanding how awareness events could impact laypeople’s perceptions and attitudes, health care organizations have the opportunity to estimate the influence of their promotional health events on laypeople’s behavior for future planning.<br>
                        <p>
                        <h4>Goals</h4>
                        <p>The central objective of our study is to understand how promotional Lynch syndrome-related health information impact laypeople’s discussions on Twitter.  This study aims to answer the following research questions:  <br>
                        <ul>RQ1. What are the most discussed topics in Lynch syndrome-related tweets?</ul>
<ul>RQ2.    How promotional Lynch syndrome-related information on Twitter affects laypeople’s discussions in terms of topic distributions?</ul>
<ul>RQ3.    Do the Colon Cancer Awareness Month (March) and the Lynch Syndrome Awareness Day (March 22) have any impact on laypeople’s discussions on Twitter and their attitudes?</ul>

                        <h3 id="Text3">Steps</h3>
                        <ul>Step 1. Data collection and preprocessing.  We collected public tweets based on a set of keywords related to Lynch syndrome using the Twitter application programming interface (API).  We then filtered out non-English tweets and standardized the texts (e.g., hashtags and web links).</ul>
                        <ul>Step 2. Categorization of the tweets.  We separated laypeople’s discussions from promotional Lynch syndrome-related information.  We experimented with two methods to automatically classify the Twitter data –a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a rule-based classifier.</ul>
<ul>Step 3. Topic modeling and sentiment analysis.
<ul>A.  Topic modeling.  We used the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model to determine the major discussion themes in the collected Twitter dataset for both promotional information and laypeople’s discussions.</ul>
<ul>B.  Sentiment analysis.  We built a CNN to assign each tweet in the laypeople’s discussions with a sentiment label, namely: positive, negative, and neutral. </ul></ul>
<ul>Step 4. Research questions.  Examine the relationships between promotional Lynch syndrome-related information and laypeople’s discussions through analyzing the results of topic modeling and sentiment analysis.  We presented frequency tables for Lynch syndrome-related topics on Twitter; correlations between promotional Lynch syndrome-related information and laypeople’s discussions; and trends of topics/sentiments in relation to awareness during the 2017 March Colon Cancer Awareness Month and the March 22 Lynch Syndrome Awareness Day</ul>

                        <h3 id="Text4">Statistics</h3>
                        <h4>Step 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing</h4>
                        <p>
Using the Twitter API via a Twitter crawler,[16] a total of 16,667 tweets were collected from Oct 26, 2016 to August 11, 2017.  After preprocessing and removal of non-English tweets, there were 14,564 tweets left.  Fig 2 shows the monthly distribution of the English tweets during that time period.<br>

                        <img src="images\Fig2.png" height="20%" width="80%" align="middle" alt="Percent Poverty">
                        <h4>Step 3A: Topic modeling</h4>
<p>We tried all three statistical methods to find the number of topics in the Lynch syndrome-related tweets (i.e., tweets that were classified as relevant).  As shown in Fig. 3, none of the three methods converged and allowed us to select the appropriate number of topics.<br>

                        <img src="images\Fig3.png" height="20%" width="80%" alt="Percent Poverty">
                        <p>Thus, we experimented with 10, 15, 20, and 30 topics and used word clouds to visualize the results.  In each iteration varying the number of topics K (=10, 15, 20, and 30), two coders were presented with the word clouds and a set of example tweets of the topics and were asked to assign each topic a label based on their judgments, independently.  Each coder was also asked to identify (1) duplicate topics; and (2) topics with poor quality (i.e., the keywords in the topic did not represent a cohesive concept).  We then chose a K that generated the least number of duplicate topics and inadequate topics.  We determined that the most adequate number of topics was 10, and identified the labels for all topics.  In cases where the coders did not agree on the particular label, the conflicts were resolved through discussions with the entire study team.  We also merged the topics that had similar semantics into a single category.  For example, “awareness event” typically contains event information to raise Lynch syndrome awareness; while the tweets in the “awareness” theme raise Lynch syndrome knowledge.  We thus combined “awareness event” and “awareness” to “awareness/awareness event.”  The final extracted topics and associated word clouds are shown in Fig. 4. <br>

                        <h4>RQ1: What are the thematic topics in Lynch syndrome-related tweets?</h4>
<p>We plotted a histogram of tweet volumes by topic and ranked the topics by volume as shown in Fig. 5.<br>
